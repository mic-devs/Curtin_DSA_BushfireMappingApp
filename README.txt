All necessary code is inside of the Code folder. It includes 14 classes that make up the program. As well as location.txt and UAVdata.txt for sample data. 

To run program, simply compile Menu.java and run that alone. That's it!

In the event you would like to use a different set of sample data files:
Step 1: Open Menu.java
Step 2: In line 17, swap "location.txt." with the new location data file name
Step 2: In line 18, swap "UAVdata.txt." with the new UAV data file name
NOTE: Ensure your new data files are inside of the Code folder!
